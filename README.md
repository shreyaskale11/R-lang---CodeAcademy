In R, vectors are a list-like structure that contain items of the same data type.
```{r}
phone <- c(25,255,2525)
typeof(phone)
print(length(phone))
```
When we use the & operator, we are checking that two things are true:
If we only care about either condition being true, we can use the | operator:

```
sort(c(2,4,10,5,1)); # Outputs c(1,2,4,5,10)
length(c(2,4,10,5,1)); # Outputs 5
sum(5,15,10) #Outputs 30
```

The pipe operator, or %>%, helps increase the readability of data frame code by piping the value on its left into the first argument of the function that follows it. 

```
df %>%
  head()
```
Filter the rows of artists where the genre is 'Rock' and spotify_monthly_listeners is greater than 20000000. Save the result to popular_rock_groups, and view it.
```
popular_rock_groups<-artists  %>%
  filter(genre == 'Rock'&spotify_monthly_listeners>20000000 )
popular_rock_groups
```

```
korea_or_before_2000<-artists  %>%
  filter(country == 'South Korea' | year_founded  < 2000)
korea_or_before_2000

```

```{r}
# filter rows with not !
not_rock_groups<-artists %>% filter(!(genre == 'Rock'))

not_rock_groups
```

```
group_asc<- artists %>% arrange(group)
group_asc

```

```{r}
# arrange rows in descending order
youtube_desc<- artists %>% arrange(desc(youtube_subscribers))
youtube_desc
```
Update the call to mutate() by adding one last argument that adds a new column rank_change_13_to_16 that is the change in rank from 2013 to 2016 (rank_2016 - rank_2013).
```
dogs <- dogs %>%
  mutate(avg_height = (height_low_inches + height_high_inches)/2,avg_weight = (weight_low_lbs  + weight_high_lbs)/2,rank_change_13_to_16 = (rank_2016 - rank_2013) )
head(dogs)
```
dplyrâ€™s transmute() function will add new columns while dropping the existing columns that may no longer be useful for your analysis. 
```
dogs <- dogs %>%
  transmute(breed = breed,avg_height = (height_low_inches + height_high_inches)/2,
         avg_weight = (weight_low_lbs + weight_high_lbs)/2,
        rank_change_13_to_16 = rank_2016 - rank_2013)
head(dogs)
```
save col name 
```
new_col_names <- colnames(dogs)
new_col_names 
```
Update the name of avg_height to avg_height_inches, avg_weight to avg_weight_lbs, and rank_change_13_to_16 to popularity_change_13_to_16. Save the updated data frame to dogs.
```
dogs <- dogs %>%
rename(avg_height_inches = avg_height , 
 avg_weight_lbs = avg_weight , 
  popularity_change_13_to_16 =rank_change_13_to_16 )
```
